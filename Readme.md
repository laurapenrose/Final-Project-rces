# Final Project Research Computing

## Scientific Question:
Investigate changes in sea ice concentration the past 30 years in the Arctic and Antarctic. My hypothsis is that sea ice concentration would have decreased over this 30 year period. I expect that there will be variations between the Arctic and the Antarctic with a high decrease in the Arctic. 

## Analysis Plan:

1. Make plots with a polar projection over Arctic to demonstrate the changes in sea ice concentration. Make a map of sea ice concentration in 1981 and 2019 to demonstrate the changes over this time period. 

2. Make plots with a polar projection over Antarctic to demonstrate the changes in sea ice concentration. Make a map of sea ice concentration in 1981 and 2019 to demonstrate the changes over this time period. 

3. Make a global sea ice concentration anomaly plot to show different years sea ice concentrations and demonstrate the changes. 

4. Separate the Northern and Southern Hemisphere and see if there are variations in sea ice concentration anomalies between the two hemispheres. 

5. Using the Sea Ice Extent dataset, look at the variation in sea ice extent  and identify the years that had the lowest sea ice extent and compare to the sea ice concentration anomaly.
