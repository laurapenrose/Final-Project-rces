# Final Project Research Computing

## Scientific Question:
Investigate changes in sea ice concentration the past 30 years in the Arctic and Antarctic. 

## Analysis Plan:

1. Make a plot showing the anomalies of sea ice concentration from 1982 to 2019. Which years had a higher concentration in sea ice? Was this the same in the Arctic and the Antarctic?  

2. Make plots with a polar projection over Arctic to demonstrate the changes in sea ice concentration. Starting at 1982, make maybe 9 plots over the past 30 years to show the changes visually. 

3. Make plots with a polar projection over Antarctica to demonstrate the changes in sea ice concentration. Starting at 1982, make maybe 9 plots over the past 30 years to show the changes visually.
